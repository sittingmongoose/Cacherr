# Cacherr — Claude Code Notes

## Goal
Work only inside this repository and keep changes small and reviewable.

## Workflow
- Prefer a short plan first, then implement.
- Run relevant tests/linters after changes (fill in commands below).

## Commands (fill these in)
- Install:
- Dev:
- Test:
- Lint:

## Conventions
- Don't add secrets or tokens to the repo.
- Keep edits focused; avoid drive-by refactors.
- Always use the Context7 MCP server when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
